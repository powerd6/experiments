# Defining structure for content authoring

`Explanation of what the experiment is about and what it is trying to achieve`

## Options

### Option A

A single self-containing file with markdown text inlined.

Some markdown syntax extensions can be expected (like github's table syntax).

### Option B

A collection of files that get combined before shipping.

This would allow each part of the content to be written on the most appropriate format (like `body` being a markdown file).

## Conclusions

`Explain what were the things that were noticed and what conclusions were drawn`
